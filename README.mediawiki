 $ make
 
 For dev mode(debbuging, manual file load) use `?debug=1` at end of URL: e.g. `file://rhizifolder/html.index?debug=1`

== Neo4J DB management ==

* Use <code>$ neo4j-shell -file reset-db__single_link.cypher</code> to bring the DB to an empty state, excluding two nodes and a single link.

Test code makes use of Python's unittest - run by invoking them with python,
or by creating a launch configuration in your IDE of choice.
