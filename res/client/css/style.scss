// Hacks

// Not sure this bug is the problem, but we don't want svg selection, and since
// editing svg nodes inline is done with an input foreign element, this doesn't
// affect selecting there!
// See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18124820/html5-svg-text-selection-bug-in-chrome
svg text::selection { background: none; }
